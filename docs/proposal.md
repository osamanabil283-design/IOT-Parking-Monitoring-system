We want to monitor parking space availability for urban parking lots and street-side parking, because it impacts drivers' waiting time, traffic congestion, and city parking management. We will use data from ultrasonic sensors, infrared sensors, and camera-based detection systems at real-time, per-second granularity. Success looks like maintaining at least 95% accuracy in detecting free vs occupied parking spots and reducing average parking search time by 30%. Constraints: privacy of camera data, low latency for real-time updates, limited compute on edge devices, and low deployment cost.
